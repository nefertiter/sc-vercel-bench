        The StartRIGHT Service Does it All.
        <p>
          With the StartRIGHT Service, you can rest assured that you, the vision
          God planted in your heart, and the members of your church are
          protected. We come alongside you and take care of everything. You can
          get back to pursuing your vision, while we do all of the heavy
          lifting. Speaking of heavy lifting, here is what some of that entails.
        </p>
        Incorporation* With the StartRIGHT Service, our specialists will help
        you develop articles of incorporation* that will give you a strong legal
        shield, ensuring your limited legal liability, and will protect you and
        your members. You can create articles of incorporation* that reflect
        your vision and mission. Getting incorporated also gives you the ability
        to license and ordain ministers of the Gospel and serves as the legal
        birth of your organization. FEIN
        <p>
          We obtain your personal Federal Employer Identification Number, and
          provide you with all of the information you need to open a church bank
          account, enabling you to take tax-deductible tithes and offerings.
          This number is used to identify your corporation and is needed for
          business and federal purposes. This number may also be known as a Tax
          ID Number.
        </p>
        Bylaws*
        <p>
          Other than the Scriptures, the bylaws* are the most important document
          in your church. The StartRIGHT Service empowers you to select the
          bylaws* that protect your vision, your ministry, and your members,
          adopting the governmental structure that reflects your ministry
          structure and allowing the pastor&apos;s vision to be kept clear.
        </p>
        Policies
        <p>
          Many church leaders feel a desire to craft supporting policies but are
          overwhelmed at the process of developing the correct wording that will
          accurately develop such policies. With the StartRIGHT Service, we
          assist you in developing essential policies that help establish and
          protect your board of directors and those helping lead your ministry.
        </p>
        Tax-Exempt Status
        <p>
          We understand that planting a church can be a difficult journey, which
          is why we have made it very simple, secure, and affordable for every
          church to obtain tax-exempt status. We fill out the 501(c)(3)
          application with you, using the information that you give us, and we
          guarantee that you will be approved for your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
          status or your money back.
        </p>
        Ordination
        <p>
          Many ministers believe that they are only able to plant a church if
          they have either been ordained or licensed as ministers of the gospel.
          However, after establishing a church on a solid legal foundation, you
          can become ordained right through the very church you started. We
          provide all of the needed paperwork that empowers your ministry to
          ordain ministers, including the founder.
